# India_Wheat_Production_Prediction_Model
This is my first data science project and it's focused on predicting India's annual wheat production. The project utilizes an M5P model trained on historical data from 1970 to 2025, using key external factors such as precipitation, humidity, and temperature. The goal is to build a robust predictive model that can accurately forecast wheat yields.
